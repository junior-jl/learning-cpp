/*
Problem-2 
You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].
Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from the index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:
 0 <= j <= nums[i] 
 i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n â€“ 1].
Example-1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2


Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
