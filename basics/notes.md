# Notes

## Preprocessor directives

Lines starting with # are known as preprocessor directives.

## White space

C++ compiler ignores white spaces.

## Namespace

A namespace is a region that defines the context in which variables and functions can be used. All the elements of the C++ standard library are declared within a region called an `std`.

## main() function

It is the point from where the C++ program starts its execution.

## Hello, World

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

Anything written inside double quotes is known as a `string`.

## endl

We can use `endl` with `cout` to add a new line after the text.

## Comments

Comments are lines ignored by the compiler. They are used to make the code more readable.

### Single-line comments

We write a single-line comment after two backslashes //.

### Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments start with /\* and end with \*/.

## Variables

A variable is a location in the computer's memory where we can store data. The value of this data can be changed during the execution of a program. Each variable has a unique and meaninful name which is known as an **identifier**.

### Variable declaration

```cpp
variable_datatype variable_name;
```

We can declare more than one variable in a single line.

```cpp
int number1, number2, number3;
```

### Variable initialization

```cpp
variable_datatype variable_name = variable_value;
```

### Variable declaration and initialization in one step

```cpp
int number = 100;
```

To print the value of a variable, use `cout` followed by the insertion operator `<<` and variable name.

### Identifiers

**Best coding practice**: Use descriptive and meaningful names for the variables to make the code self-explanatory.

#### Rules

- An identifier can only contain uppercase alphabets, lowercase alphabets, numbers, and underscore.
- The first letter of an identifier can be an alphabet or an underscore (not a good practice).
- The first letter of an identifier cannot be a number.
- C++ is a case-sensitive language.
- An identifier cannot contain white space.
- An identifier cannot have special characters such as \&, \@, \*, \!, etc.
- We cannot use keywords as identifiers (Keywords are a collection of reserved words and predefined identifiers in C++, like `return`, `if`, ...).

## Constants or literals

**Constants** are similar to variables except that we can't change their value during the code execution.

The basic syntax for creating a constant is:

```cpp
const constant_datatype constant_name = constant_value;
```

**Common programming error**: In C++, you have to initialize a constant at the time of its declaration. If you donâ€™t initialize a constant at the time of creating it, an error will occur.

## Data Types

**Data type** tells the compiler what type of data a particular variable can store. The compiler allocates the memory to the variable based on its data type.

- Specify the type of value a particular variable can store.
- Reserve the number of bytes for a variable in memory.

### Primitive or Fundamental Data Types

- int
- float
- double
- char
- boolean
- void

#### Integer

Comprises all positive and negative whole numbers. We use the `int` keyword to define the integer data type. A variable of `int` type is allocated 4 bytes of memory. It can store any value from $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31} - 1$.

```cpp
int integer_number = 100;
```

If you store 100.5 in an `int`, it will be truncated to 100.

#### Floating-point

It contains a number with a fractional part. We use the `float` keyword to define the floating-point data type. A variable of `float` type is allocated 4 bytes of memory. It can store any value in the range $\pm 3.40 \times 10^{\pm38}$.

```cpp
float float_number = 10.7;
```

#### Double

It contains a number with a fractional part. We use the `double` keyword to define the double data type. A variable of `double` type is allocated 8 bytes of memory. It can store any value in the range of $\pm 1.79 \times 10^{\pm 308}$.

```cpp
double double_number = 10.65417;
```

A `float` can store seven digits after a decimal point precisely. Whereas, `double` can store 15 digits after a decimal point precisely. It is recommended to use `double` for floating-point values.

#### Character

It contains a single character from the ASCII set. We use the `char` keyword to define the character data type. A variable of `char` type is allocated 1 byte of memory. It can store value from $-2^7$ to $2^7 - 1$.

```cpp
char character = 'b';
```

A `char` value is always written in single quotation marks.

#### Boolean

It stores a logical value. It can store `true` or `false`. We can also use `1` to represent `true` and `0` to represent `false`. We use the `bool` keyword to define the boolean data type. A variable of `bool` type is allocated 1 byte of memory.

```cpp
bool boolean = false;
```

#### Void

The `void` data type represents an entity without a value. It will be used in functions.

### Derived Data Types

- Function
- Array
- Pointer
- Reference

### User-defined Data Types

- Structure
- Union
- Enum
- Class
- Typedef

## Data Type Modifiers

Data Type Modifiers are used with primitive data types to change the meaning of predefined data types according to the situation.

C++ supports the following data type modifiers:

- long
- short
- unsigned
- signed

We can use data type modifiers with `int`, `double` and `char` data types.

### long

It is used to increase the length of a data type to 4 more bytes. We can use `long` with `int` and `double` data types.

### short

It decreases the avaliable length of a data type to 2 bytes. We can use `short` with an `int` data type.

### unsigned

It allows us to store positive values only. We can use `unsigned` with `char` and `int` data types. With `unsigned int`, we can store any value from 0 to 4294967295. With `unsigned char`, we can store any value from 0 to 255.

### signed

It allows us to store both positive and negative values. We can use `signed` with `char` and `int` data types. With `signed int` we can store any value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. With `signed char`, we can store any value from -128 to 127.

## Type-casting

It is a way to convert the value of one data type to another data type.

### Implicit casting

The compiler automatically converts one data type to another.

```cpp
int x = 13.9;
```

To avoid data loss, we should always do type-casting from smaller to larger data types.

### Explicit casting

The user manually converts one data type to another. The basic syntax for explicit type casting in C++ is:

```cpp
(data_type) variable_name;
```

## String

It is plain text that represents alphanumeric data. A string comprises one or more characters. It is always written inside double quotes.

```cpp
string text = "Hey12345";
```

Strings are not allocated a fixed amount of memory during the time of declaration.

## Escape sequence

An escape sequence comprises two or more characters that are used to modify the format of the output. The first character in the escape sequence is the backslash \\. The most commonly used escape sequences are:

| **Escape Sequence** |   **Meaning**   |                    **Description**                    |
|:-------------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|
|          \n         |     New Line    |   Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line  |
|          \t         |  Horizontal Tab |   Moves the cursor up to 8 spaces towards the right   |
|          \"         |   Double Quote  |           Inserts double quote in the output          |
|          \r         | Carriage Return | Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line |
|          \\         |    Backslash    |              Displays backslash character             |
|          \'         |   Single Quote  |           Inserts single quote in the output          |
|          \b         |    Backspace    |               Deletes the last character              |

## User input

In input operation, we take data from the user and store it in the memory.

### Syntax

```cpp
cin >> variable_name;
```

We use a `cin` in combination with the extraction operator `>>` to take input from the user.
